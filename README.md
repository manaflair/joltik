[Check out our other OSS projects!](https://manaflair.github.io)

## Installation

**Json-Server is not yet ready to be used in a production environment - some security checks are still missing, and you wouldn't be able to prevent your users from altering your data in some unexpected ways.**

```
$> npm install --save @manaflair/json-server
```

## Usage

```js
import { makeSequelizeBackend } from '@manaflair/json-server/sequelize';
import { JsonServer }           from '@manaflair/json-server';
import express                  from 'express';

import { User, Post, Comment }  from './models';

let server = express();

let jsonServer = new JsonServer({ baseUrl: `http://example.org/api` });
server.use(jsonServer.middleware);

jsonServer.add(makeSequelizeBackend(User));
jsonServer.add(makeSequelizeBackend(Post));
jsonServer.add(makeSequelizeBackend(Comment));

server.listen(80);
```
